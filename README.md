# ConcisePureLayout
**ConcisePureLayout** was created to facilitate the method invocations of [PureLayout library](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout "PureLayout github page"). _(Objective-C only, Swift comming next)._

##Installation
```objective-c
pod 'ConcisePureLayout'
```

>**Dependency**
>
**ConcisePureLayout** is based on third party [PureLayout library](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout "PureLayout github page"). So, PureLayout  will be installed along with ConcisePureLayout.

#Contribution
ConcisePureLayout still very young. Not all methods of PureLayout have been simplified with it. Simplification of the remaining methods require time and rethinking how to do it better. Let's do it together!
It would be great if together we get something as simple as powerful.</br>
Please, fork & PR!
