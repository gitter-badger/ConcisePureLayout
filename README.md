# ConcisePureLayout
ConcisePureLayout was created to facilitate the method invocations of PureLayout library (Objective-C only, Swift comming next).

##Installation
```
pod 'ConcisePureLayout'
```

>**Dependency**
>
Because ConcisePureLayout was based on PureLayout, you must manually add a PureLayout library into your project. Goto official PureLayout github page for installation instructions.

##Examples
In this screenshot, every UI element was placed by ConcisePureLayout category methods.
